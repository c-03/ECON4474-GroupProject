# ECON4474-GroupProject
ECON 4474 is a course at HKUST focused on Hong Kongâ€™s economy. This repository contains materials from my group project, including raw data, Python scripts for data analysis, and the final term paper examining the impacts of the Statutory Minimum Wage Ordinance on income inequality in Hong Kong. Our study explores both quantitative and qualitative perspectives, utilising Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis.
